Angular Velocity at the plasma centre (R = 0.25 m) is 6.67e+06 /s

Viscous Heating is 10.2 kW
Bremsstrahlung losses are 30.9 W
Cyclotron emission losses are 650 µW
Heat loss due to charge exchange with neutrals is 1.54 kW

Total potential drop is 100 kV
Radial Current Drawn from Power Supply 495 mA
Power Required (at the plasma) to support rotation 49.5 kW
	 Power Loss from viscous torque  10.2 kW
	 Power Loss from parallel loss   9.27 kW
	 Power Loss from charge exchange 30.1 kW

Total Stored Energy is 5.53 kJ
 of which 4.38 kJ is kinetic energy in the rotation
      and 1.15 kJ is thermal energy of the plasma
Energy Confinement Time is 113 ms
Of which
	Confinement time from parallel losses is	230 ms
	Confinement time from perpendicular losses is	187 ms
	Confinement time from charge-exchange losses is	291 ms

Particle (Ion) Confinement Time ~= 218 ms

Ion-Electron Temperature Equilibration Time is 44.3 ms

Plasma must be provided at a rate of 2.17e+18 electrons /s to maintain steady-state

Neutral gas must be provided at a rate of 2.17e+18 particles/s to refuel the plasma
This leads to a steady-state neutral density of 3.71e+13/m^3
The level of charge-exchange losses due to the neutrals is 6.48e+18 particles/s lost
	 This is equivalent to a heat loss rate of 1.54 kW
